This is Tad's FlickrToy.

All this application does is to get and display recently uploaded photos to Flickr.

NOTE: Since these are photos that anyone might have uploaded to Flickr, it is possible that the web app will display
NSFW photos.  This is relatively rare, but you will see some if you keep refreshing.

I've decided to stop refactoring and re-do the code in a TDD fashion.  I will create another Git repository for that
when it's ready.

NOTE:
You will need to provide your own FlickrAPI key in order to get the code to function properly.  Please take a look at
Flickr's developer documentation.

The code goes into the URL at the top of the FlickrService.cs file.
